# Fraud-Detection
I have developed a Credit Card Fraud Detection model to categorize a transaction as Fraud or Legitimate with very high accuracy using different Machine Learning Models.

##Frameworks/Tools/Libraries used :
Pandas Dataframe
Scikit-learn (Sklearn)
Matplotlib

###We have built the model using “StratifiedKFold Cross Validation” methodology.
This cross-validation  is a variation of KFold that returns stratified folds. The folds are made by preserving the percentage of samples for each class.
The following models have been used based on this methodology :
*Random Forest
*Logistic Regression with L1 Regularisation
*Logistic Regression with L2 Regularisation
